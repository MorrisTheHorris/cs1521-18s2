Show what the following decimal values look like in 8-bit binary, 3-digit octal, and 2-digit hexadecimal:
|Decimal|Binary|Octal|Hexadecimal|
|----|---|---|---|
|1   |0000 0001   |001   |01   |
|8   |0000 1000   | 010  | 08  |
|10  |0000 1010   | 012  | 0A  |

How could I write a C program to answer this question?

Could use `printf` statements with `%o` and `%x` formats fro octal and hexadecimal respectively. For binary use some sort of bit manipulation.
