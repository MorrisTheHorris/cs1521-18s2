Consider the following pair of variables

```c
int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0
```
If each of the following statements is executed in turn, starting from the above state, show the value of both variables after each statement:
```c
p = &x;
x = 5;
*p = 3;
x = (int)p;
x = (int)&p;
p = NULL;
*p = 1;
```
If any of the statements would trigger an error, state what the error would be
