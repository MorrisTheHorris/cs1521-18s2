Consider the following pair of variables

```c
int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0
```
If each of the following statements is executed in turn, starting from the above state, show the value of both variables after each statement:
```c
p = &x;         // p = 1000, x = 0
x = 5;          // p = 1000, x = 5
*p = 3;         // p = 1000, x = 3
x = (int)p;     // p = 1000, x = 1000
x = (int)&p;    // p = 1000, x = 2000
p = NULL;       // p = 0, x = 2000
*p = 1;         // Seg fault / cannot dereference null pointer
```
If any of the statements would trigger an error, state what the error would be
