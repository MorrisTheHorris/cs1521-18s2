Consider the following C program skeleton:
```c
int  a;
char b[100];
    
int fun1() { int c, d; ... }
    
double e;
    
int fun2() { int f; static int ff; ... fun1() ... }
    
unsigned int g;
    
int main(void) { char h[10]; int i; ... fun2() ... }
```
 Now consider what happens during the execution of this program and answer the following:
- Which variables are accessible from within `main()`?
- Which variables are accessible from within `fun2()`?
- Which variables are accessible from within `fun1()`?
- Which variables are removed when `fun1()` returns?
- Which variables are removed when `fun2()` returns?
- How long does the variable `f` exist during program execution?
- How long does the variable `g` exist during program execution?
- How long does the variable `ff` exist during program execution?
