Consider a scenario where we have the following flags controlling access to a device.

```c
#define READING   0x01
#define WRITING   0x02
#define AS_BYTES  0x04
#define AS_BLOCKS 0x08
#define LOCKED    0x10
```

The flags are contained in an 8-bit register, defined as:

```c
unsigned char device;
```
Write C expressions to implement each of the following:
- mark the device as locked for reading bytes
- mark the device as locked for writing blocks
- set the device as locked, leaving other flags unchanged
- remove the lock on a device, leaving other flags unchanged
- switch a device between reading and writing, leaving other flags unchanged
