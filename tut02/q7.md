Consider a scenario where we have the following flags controlling access to a device.

```c
#define READING   0x01
#define WRITING   0x02
#define AS_BYTES  0x04
#define AS_BLOCKS 0x08
#define LOCKED    0x10
```

The flags are contained in an 8-bit register, defined as:

```c
unsigned char device;
```
Write C expressions to implement each of the following:
- mark the device as locked for reading bytes

        device = LOCKED | READING | AS_BYTES;

- mark the device as locked for writing blocks

        device = LOCKED | WRITING | AS_BLOCKS;

- set the device as locked, leaving other flags unchanged

        device |= LOCKED;

- remove the lock on a device, leaving other flags unchanged

        device &= ~LOCKED;

- switch a device between reading and writing, leaving other flags unchanged

        device = device & ~READING | WRITING
