Consider a Stack data type like the one defined in lectures:
```c
// Interface to Stack data type
    
#define MAX_STACK 1000
    
typedef char Item;
    
typedef struct _stack {
    int  top;
    Item items[MAX_STACK];
} Stack;
    
void initStack(Stack *s);
int  pushStack(Stack *s, Item val);
Item popStack(Stack *s);
int  isEmptyStack(Stack s);
void showStack(Stack s);
```
Some of the functions have a parameter which is defined as `Stack *s`, while others have a `Stack s` parameter.
- Why might we define the parameters differently like this?

    Ones with pointers change the stack, those without don't.

- Assuming that the stack parameter's name is `s`, how would you refer to the top field within the function `initStack()` and within the function `isEmptyStack()`?

        s->top;
        s.top;

- Are there any disadvantages to the parameter type used by `isEmptyStack()` and `showStack()`?

    Copying large amounts of memory, could be bad if stack is big (with small memory computers) or inefficient.
