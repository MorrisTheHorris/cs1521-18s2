 Assume that we have the following 16-bit variables defined and initialised:

```c
unsigned short a, b, c;
a = 0x5555;  b = 0xAAAA;  c = 0x0001;
```

What are the values of the following expressions:

    a | b (bitwise OR)      
    a & b (bitwise AND)
    a ^ b (bitwise XOR)
    a & ~b (bitwise AND)
    c << 6 (left shift)
    a >> 4 (right shift)
    a & (b << 1)
    b | c
    a & ~c

 Give your answer in hexadecimal, but you might find it easier to convert to binary to work out the solution.

    a | b = 0xFFFF
    a & b = 0x0000
    a ^ b = 0xFFFF
    a & ~b = 0xAAAA
    c << 6 = 0x0040
    a >> 4 = 0x0555
    a & (b << 1) = 0x5555
    b | c = 0xAAAB
    a & ~c = 0x5554
