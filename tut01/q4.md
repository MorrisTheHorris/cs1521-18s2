Consider the following `struct` definition defining a type for points in a three-dimensional space:
```c
typedef struct _Coord {
    unsigned int x;
    unsigned int y;
    unsigned int z;
} Coord;
```

and the program fragment using `Coord` variables and pointers to them

```c
int main(void) {
    Coord a, b, coords[10], *p;
    a.x = 5;
    a.y = 6;
    a.z = 7;
    p = &a;
    b.x = 3;
    b.y = 3;
    b.z = 3;
    /*A*/
    (*p).x = 6;
    p->y++;
    p->z++;
    b = *p;
    /*B*/
}
```

- Draw diagrams to show the state of the variables `a`, `b` and `p` at points `/*A*/` and `/*B*/`

At A, `a = <5,6,7>, b = <3,3,3>, p = &a`

At B, `a = <6,7,8>, b = <6,7,8>, p = &a`

- Why would a statement like `*p.x++;` be incorrect?

Operator precendence, `.` is acting before `*` and since `p` is not a struct `gcc` will complain.

- Write code to iterate over the `coords` array using just the variable `p` and setting each item in the array to (0, 0, 0). Do not use an index variable.

```c
for (p = &coords[0]; p < &coords[10]; p++) {
    p->x = 0;
    p->y = 0;
    p->z = 0;
    // or
    *p = (Coord){0, 0, 0};
}
```
