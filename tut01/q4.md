Consider the following `struct` definition defining a type for points in a three-dimensional space:
```c
typedef struct _Coord {
    unsigned int x;
    unsigned int y;
    unsigned int z;
} Coord;
```

and the program fragment using `Coord` variables and pointers to them

```c
int main(void) {
    Coord a, b, coords[10], *p;
    a.x = 5;
    a.y = 6;
    a.z = 7;
    p = &a;
    b.x = 3;
    b.y = 3;
    b.z = 3;
    /*A*/
    (*p).x = 6;
    p->y++;
    p->z++;
    b = *p;
    /*B*/
}
```

- Draw diagrams to show the state of the variables `a`, `b` and `p` at points `/*A*/` and `/*B*/`
- Why would a statement like `*p.x++;` be incorrect?
- Write code to iterate over the `coords` array using just the variable `p` and setting each item in the array to (0, 0, 0). Do not use an index variable.
