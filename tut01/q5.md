What is the effect of each of the `static` declarations in the following program fragment:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
    
static int x1;
...
static int f(int n) {
    static int x2 = 0;
    ...
}
```
---
The first variable is visible only inside the file it is declared in (scope is limited to the file).

The function is only visible inside the file it is declared in (same as above).

The second variable will preserve values across function calls for the lifetime of the program.
