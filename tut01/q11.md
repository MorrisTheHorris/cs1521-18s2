Consider the following FIFO queue interface in a file `Queue.h`: 
```c
#ifndef QUEUE_H
#define QUEUE_H

#define MAXQ 6

typedef struct {
    int nitems;
    int head;
    int tail;
    int items[MAXQ];
} Queue;

// initialise a Queue
void initQueue(Queue *q);
// insert a new item at the tail of the Queue
void enterQueue(Queue *, int);
// remove/return the item at the head of the Queue
int leaveQueue(Queue *);
// return the number of items currently in the Queue
int lengthQueue(Queue);
// display the contents of the Queue
void showQueue(Queue);

#endif
```
Using the above, answer the following questions:
- What is the purpose of the lines involving the symbol `QUEUE_H`?
- Why do some functions take a pointer to a `Queue` and others take a `Queue` as argument?
- Implement the operations on the queue, treating it as a "circular array" (i.e. when the `head` or `tail` reaches the end of the array, they advance by returning to the start of the array). The following diagram shows the state of the queue after the following sequence of enters and leaves: `+1 +4 +5 +7 - - +6 +9 - +2`

- Implement the operations on the queue, treating it as a "sliding array" (i.e. when an element is taken from the `head`, all of the items slide down by one position, and so item 0 is always the head). The following diagram shows the state of the queue after the following sequence of enters and leaves: `+1 +4 +5 +7 - - +6 +9 - +2`

- Can you simplify the concrete representation when using a "sliding array"?
