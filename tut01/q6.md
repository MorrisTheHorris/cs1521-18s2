What is the difference in meaning between the following pairs (a/b and c/d) of groups of C statements: 

a. 
```c
if (x == 0) {
    printf("zero\n");
}
```

b. 
```c
if (x == 0)
    printf("zero\n");
```
c. 
```c
if (x == 0) {
    printf("zero\n");
    printf("after\n");
}
```
d. 
```c
if (x == 0)
    printf("zero\n");
    printf("after\n");
```
---
a and b are identical.

c will print both lines iff x == 0, but d will print the second line always.
